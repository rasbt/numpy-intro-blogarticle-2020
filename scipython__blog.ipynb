    "This section offers a quick tour of the NumPy library for working with multi-dimensional arrays in Python. NumPy (short for Numerical Python) was created in 2005 by merging Numarray into Numeric. Since then, the open source NumPy library has evolved into an essential library for scientific computing in Python. It has become a building block of many other scientific libraries, such as SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and others.\n",
    "What makes NumPy so incredibly attractive to the scientific community is that it provides a convenient Python interface for working with multi-dimensional array data structures efficiently; the NumPy array data structure is also called `ndarray`, which is short for *n*-dimensional array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being mostly implemented in C and using Python as a \"glue language,\" the main reason why NumPy is so efficient for numerical computations is that NumPy arrays use contiguous blocks of memory that can be efficiently cached by the CPU. In contrast, Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects in random locations in memory, which cannot be easily cached and come with a more expensive memory-look-up. However, the computational efficiency and low-memory footprint come at a cost: NumPy arrays have a fixed size and are homogeneous, which means that all elements must have the same type. Homogenous `ndarray` objects have the advantage that NumPy can carry out operations using efficient C code and avoid expensive type checks and other overheads of the Python API. While adding and removing elements from the end of a Python list is very efficient, altering the size of a NumPy array is very expensive since it requires to create a new array and carry over the contents of the old array that we want to expand or shrink. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being more efficient for numerical computations than native Python code, NumPy can also be more elegant and readable due to vectorized operations and broadcasting, which are features that we will explore in this article. "

However, it is often useful to create separate `RandomState` objects for various parts of our code, so that we can test methods of functions reliably in unit tests.

    "Lastly, we will briefly cover Matplotlib in this article. Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python created by John D. Hunter in 2003. Unfortunately, John D. Hunter became ill and past away in 2012. However, Matplot is still the most mature plotting library, and is being maintained until this day.\n",

    "In general, Matplotlib is a rather \"low-level\" plotting library, which means that it has a lot of room for customization. The advantage of Matplotlib is that it is so customizable; the disadvantage of Matplotlib is that it is so customizable -- some people find it a little bit too verbose due to all the different options.\n",

    "In any case, Matplotlib is among the most widely used plotting library and the go-to choice for many data scientists and machine learning researchers and practictioners.\n",

    "In my opinion, the best way to work with Matplotlib is to use the Matplotlib gallery on the official website at [https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) often. It contains code examples for creating various different kinds of plots, which are useful as templates for creating your own plots. Also, if you are completely new to Matplotlib, I recommend the tutorials at [https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html).\n",
